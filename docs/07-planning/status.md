# Status

**Last updated:** 2026-09-05
**Current phase:** P0 · Foundation — not yet started
**Updated by:** Thomas (session continued by Claude Code after the OpenAI agent and
GitHub Copilot both hit usage limits mid-session — see the session log)

> Update this at the end of every working session. It is the first thing anyone — human or
> agent — reads when picking the project up cold.

## Where we are

Planning complete, and substantially deepened in this session. The full documentation
corpus exists, now including three new ADRs, a formal accelerated delivery calendar, and a
changelog/release-notes convention. No application code written yet.

**Screens:** 0 of 109 complete — [inventory](../02-design/screen-inventory.md)
**Features:** 0 of 29 shipped — [index](../03-features/README.md)
**Target calendar:** UAT by 2026-09-12, go-live by 2026-10-03, full scope by end of
December 2026 — see [accelerated-delivery-plan.md](accelerated-delivery-plan.md). **This
is a target, not a deadline held under pressure** — the date is explicitly allowed to move;
the engine-pattern architecture and the security gates are what may not.

## Done

**Prior session — architecture and product decisions:**

- Analysed kaneo, Plane, OpenProject and TaskDesk v1
- Confirmed licences: kaneo MIT, Plane AGPL-3.0, OpenProject GPL-3.0. v2 is AGPL-3.0
- Locked the core decisions: kaneo as foundation (not forked), one backend, better-auth
  primary, two portals/two origins, everything pluggable, every route declares a policy,
  SLA computed on read
- Wrote ADRs 0001–0010 and the full documentation corpus — roughly 65 documents

**This session — continued after the OpenAI agent and GitHub Copilot both hit usage
limits, then GitHub Copilot too, then handed to Claude Code:**

- **Reviewed the six additionally cloned ITSM systems** (chatwoot, freescout, glpi,
  nocobase, osTicket, zammad) against their actual licences and architecture, added to
  [competitive-inspiration.md](../00-overview/competitive-inspiration.md) and
  [licensing-and-attribution.md](../00-overview/licensing-and-attribution.md). Zammad's
  configurable ticket-state model was the most directly validating find.
- **Wrote ADR 0011** — one generic lifecycle engine for every work item type, states and
  transitions fully data-driven, only a five-value `group` fixed in code.
- **Wrote ADR 0012** — a terminology overlay so domain nouns ("Ticket", "Project", "Cycle")
  are renameable per instance, separate from state naming.
- **Wrote ADR 0013** — marketplace listing and usage metering as an optional `license`
  plugin, never a default, keeping the self-hosted/no-phone-home promise intact.
- **Generalised the plugin pattern into "the engine pattern"** in
  [plugin-architecture.md](../01-architecture/plugin-architecture.md) — every feature, not
  only the six current plugin kinds, is expected to follow the same shape: contract,
  registry or settings screen, generated configuration, a feature flag, a validate/test
  affordance.
- **Reconfirmed and extended customer self-service**: customers already could raise,
  comment, escalate, approve-what's-addressed-to-them, reopen and rate their own requests;
  added the one genuine gap — **withdrawing** a submission before triage (`CP-15`,
  `IQ-16a`).
- **Added a three-tier reporting model** to
  [reports-and-dashboards.md](../03-features/reports-and-dashboards.md): fixed reports
  (unchanged), selectable row-and-column reports (a named, saved Table view), and a small
  customisable report builder — all three persisted through the existing `saved_view`
  mechanism, no new engine.
- **Corrected the tech stack against actual current status, not memory**: PostgreSQL
  16 → 18, Valkey 8 → 9, OpenAPI 3.1 → 3.2 target, and — the significant one — **dropped
  MinIO as the shipped default** after confirming its open-source edition was effectively
  wound down through 2025–2026, replacing it with SeaweedFS (default) and Garage
  (AGPL-aligned alternative). Confirmed Node 24, Traefik v3 and Keycloak 26 remain correct
  as-is. Noted kaneo's emerging Base UI dependency for action at fork time, not before.
- **Specified the one-line installer** (`curl \| bash`) in
  [one-line-install.md](../05-operations/one-line-install.md) — a thin, checksum-verified
  bootstrapper around the existing `scripts/deploy.sh`, with a documented offline path.
- **Specified the AWS Marketplace listing** in
  [aws-marketplace.md](../05-operations/aws-marketplace.md) — container-product listing
  type (not SaaS, not AMI), mandatory automatic security scanning, metering via AWS
  Marketplace Metering Service, Helm chart submission requirements, and the AGPL
  buyer-obligation note, researched against AWS's current seller documentation.
- **Added RBAC/API, OpenAPI-contract and MCP test layers** to
  [testing-strategy.md](../04-engineering/testing-strategy.md), plus a named
  cross-feature "task and work-item lifecycle" test suite.
- **Recorded a model-tier policy** for Claude Code's own subagent orchestration in
  [agent-workflow.md](../04-engineering/agent-workflow.md): Sonnet 5 implements against an
  approved spec; Opus or Fable plans and reviews; **security review is Opus, always, not
  negotiable against schedule.** Wired into [SDLC](../04-engineering/sdlc.md) stage 5 and
  the phase gate.
- **Wrote the accelerated delivery plan**
  ([accelerated-delivery-plan.md](accelerated-delivery-plan.md))** at Thomas's explicit
  request — a dated Sept–Dec 2026 calendar mapping the full P0–P7 scope in parallel
  workstreams, with every quality-gate compression named in an explicit deferral register,
  sitting alongside — not replacing — the no-dates [phases.md](phases.md). Revised the
  same day once Thomas clarified the calendar is a target, not a deadline under pressure.
- **Added `CHANGELOG.md`** and a release-notes convention in
  [ci-cd.md](../04-engineering/ci-cd.md) tying the changelog, the screen inventory and the
  feature index together at every phase close.

## Next

**P0 · Foundation.** Order matters — the gates go in before the features. Unchanged from
before this session, since P0 itself was not the subject of today's revisions:

1. Initialise the repository: copy kaneo, de-brand, strip billing and cloud-only pieces
2. `LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, `NOTICE`, `AGENTS.md`
3. Extract `packages/ui`; Tailwind preset; Storybook running
4. Split `apps/web` into agent and portal entries
5. Scaffold `packages/domain`, `packages/permissions`, `packages/plugins-contracts`
6. Route registry with the round-trip test
7. **Policy registry, route coverage test, permission matrix test** — the anti-v1 controls
8. CI pipeline with every gate, including the new contract and MCP test layers
9. UX gate scripts: tokens, ui, deps, bundle purity
10. Playwright projects; Testcontainers harness; seed scripts
11. Dockerfile, compose, Traefik, `scripts/deploy.sh`, **and the `install.sh` bootstrapper**
12. Observability: Pino, Prometheus, health endpoints
13. `apps/site` skeleton
14. Sign-in, MFA, not-found, error boundary

If the [accelerated delivery plan](accelerated-delivery-plan.md) is being followed, this
is also **week 1** of that calendar, targeting UAT-ready by 2026-09-12.

**Exit criteria:** builds, deploys locally on three hostnames, every CI gate green on an
empty application.

## Blocked

Nothing.

## Open decisions

| Decision | Deadline | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLA, for a possible dual licence | Before the first external contribution | Thomas |
| Final product name | Before P7 | Thomas |
| ~~Whether to sell externally~~ | Decided: yes, via AWS Marketplace — see [decision log](decision-log.md) | — |
| WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery | Before real customer data | Thomas |
| Whether the 4-week go-live scope needs to narrow | Escalate the moment workstream A (service-desk domain logic) looks behind, per [accelerated-delivery-plan.md](accelerated-delivery-plan.md#what-happens-if-week-4-looks-tight) | Thomas |

## Watch list

Risks currently most likely to bite. Full list in [risks.md](risks.md), now with three
additions (**R15–R17**) specific to the accelerated calendar.

| | Risk | Why now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **R15** | Workstream A (SLA/workflow/approvals port) can't realistically finish in the compressed window | It is the schedule's critical path, named on day one |
| **R2** | Phase discipline collapses | The accelerated plan deliberately runs phases in parallel — the discipline that must survive is the deferral register, not phase sequencing |
| **R1** | UX failure repeats | P0 is where the guards are installed or are not, on any calendar |
| **R17** | Parallel workstreams reproduce three-inconsistent-codebases faster than usual | Cross-agent review and CI-enforced vocabulary matter more, not less, under this pace |

## Session log

Newest first. One entry per working session.

### 2026-09-05 · Continuation — ITSM review, three new ADRs, accelerated calendar

Picked up after the OpenAI agent and then GitHub Copilot both exhausted their usage
limits mid-session. Surveyed the six additionally-cloned ITSM systems; corrected the tech
stack against actual current status (Postgres 18, Valkey 9, OpenAPI 3.2, and dropping
MinIO after confirming its open-source edition wound down through 2025–2026); wrote ADRs
0011–0013 (lifecycle engine, terminology overlay, marketplace metering); generalised the
plugin pattern into an explicit "engine pattern" required of every feature; specified the
one-line installer and the AWS Marketplace listing; added RBAC/API, OpenAPI-contract and
MCP test layers; recorded a model-tier policy for Claude Code's own subagent use, with a
mandatory Opus security checkpoint; added a three-tier reporting model; reconfirmed and
closed the one real gap in customer self-service (withdrawal); wrote a dated accelerated
delivery plan at explicit request, then revised it the same day once told the calendar is
a target and not a deadline under pressure; added `CHANGELOG.md` and a release-notes
convention.

Key conclusions:

- The MinIO finding is the sharpest example of why "check current status, don't assume
  from training" mattered this session — a plausible-sounding default would have been
  wrong within the same year it was written.
- The engine-pattern generalisation and the "dates flex, architecture doesn't" framing are
  two directions of the same instruction, and are recorded together in the decision log
  for that reason.
- Nothing in this session touched P0's actual task list. The next session should begin
  P0, step 1, exactly as previously planned.

Next session: begin P0, step 1.

### 2026-09-05 · Planning

Analysed all four reference codebases. Established licensing constraints. Made and
recorded the ten architectural decisions. Wrote the complete documentation corpus —
roughly 65 documents across nine sections.

Key conclusions:

- v1's authorization *design* is its most valuable asset and is being carried forward
  (reach vs authority, directory-resolved identity, 404-not-403). Its *frontend* is being
  discarded entirely.
- v1's real failure was process, not code: features were declared done when they
  functioned. The nine-stage SDLC and the thirteen automated UX gates exist to close that.
- The eleven authorization holes v1 shipped past a green suite were all *omissions*. The
  route policy registry converts that class of bug into a build failure.

## How to update this

At the end of every session:

1. Update the phase progress bars.
2. Update screen and feature counts.
3. Move anything finished into **Done**.
4. Restate **Next** with concrete steps, not intentions.
5. Record anything **Blocked**, with who unblocks it.
6. Add a session log entry, including what did not work.

Do not describe intent. Describe state. "Working on the board view" is not a status;
"board view renders and drags; keyboard drag not yet implemented" is.
