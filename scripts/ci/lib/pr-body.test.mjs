/**
 * Unit tests for the pull-request body parser.
 *
 * These exist because `stripComments` was a security fix, not a refactor: CodeQL
 * alert #4 (`js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`, HIGH) on the regex it
 * replaced. A sanitiser without a regression test is one careless edit away from
 * the same hole, so the invariant is asserted directly rather than implied.
 *
 * Run: `pnpm test:ci-scripts`, or `node --test scripts/ci/lib/`.
 * No test dependency — node:test ships with the runtime the gates already use.

/**
 * What the REMOVED expression produced, recorded as data rather than as code.
 *
 * The obvious way to write these tests is to keep the deleted regex here as a live
 * oracle and diff against it. That was the first attempt, and CodeQL correctly raised
 * `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization` a second time — on this file — because
 * the vulnerable pattern was still in the repository, one copy-paste away from being
 * reused by someone who did not read why it was here.
 *
 * The alert was NOT suppressed and the regex was NOT rewritten to hide from the
 * scanner. It is simply gone: the outputs it produced are recorded below as literals,
 * measured before deletion, which is all the contrast the tests actually needed.
